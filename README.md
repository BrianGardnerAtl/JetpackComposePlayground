# Jetpack Compose Playground

This sample app is where I'm going to mess arround with the new Jetpack Compose
library and learn its ins-and-outs. The goal of this project is to replicate
some sample views from popular apps to figure out how they can be created in a
composable fashion.

Some of the views I'm planning on replicating are:

* A Tweet view from Twitter (in progress)
* An Email view from Gmail

The goal of this project is to create a blog post series detailing my adventures
with composable views with some sample code that folks can use as reference.
